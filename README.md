# Anchovy Bus
APIs used: Facebook, Sparkpost

You’re the owner of Krusty Krab. When there’s a baseball game going on, your restaurant looks like this:

Wouldn’t it be nice if an app could monitor the stadium’s facebook page and email a warning to you in advance when there’s a big event tomorrow?

I think this idea is doable in a day. We need to:
* Use Facebook API to poll upcoming events (for a given Facebook group) and their attendance count
* Use Sparkpost API to send email to restaurant owners saying “At 5-7pm tomorrow there is a basketball game Flames vs Warriors. 14320 people are attending.”
* That’s it!
